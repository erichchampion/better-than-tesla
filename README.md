This site was inspired by http://takedowntesla.com and the efforts of Alex Winter. Rather that just protesting Tesla, I wanted to give folks information about the better, union-made electric vehicles that are available. 

The main page is generated from src/app/content.json to separate content from presentation and to make it easier to edit. 

Please feel free to make PRs with any suggestions you might have. 

To get up and running on http://localhost:3000, install npm or yarn and run either of these commands:

npm run dev
-or-
yarn dev
