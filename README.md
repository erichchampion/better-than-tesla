This site was inspired by http://takedowntesla.com and the efforts of Alex Winter. Rather that just protesting Tesla, I wanted to give folks information about the better, union-made electric vehicles that are available. 

The main page is generated from src/app/content.json to separate content from presentation and to make it easier to edit.
